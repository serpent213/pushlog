Write a Python script that

- uses `click`
- read a YAML file on startup containing
  * a range of (journald) priorities
  * an include and an exclude list of regexs
  * a number of seconds (`collect-timeout`)
  * a set of Pushover API and user keys
- uses `systemd` and fetches all entries since boot, then follows (like `journalctl -b -f`)
- filters each entry according to the YAML configuration
- when an entry passes the filter: waits `collect-timeout` seconds for more entries to pass
- sends the accumulated entries (or maybe just one) as Pushover notification
- stays in a loop to wait for more entries ("follow")

`collect-timeout` is supposed to make sure that a number of messages coming in at once produce only a single Pushover message. So you need to set a timer on the first message, collect more messages in the background, and then send the collected messages when the timer fires.
